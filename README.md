# Waterfox `.desktop` launcher
Waterfox `.desktop` file which adds a firefox-like behaving launcher icon into Gnome.

This `.desktop` file has been created by customising the `firefox.desktop` file for Waterfox.

Your `firefox.desktop` file should be located in `/usr/share/applications/`.

After unpacking and running Waterfox for the first time you will find a Waterfox `.desktop` file in `~/.local/share/applications/`. Edit or replace the file with this one.

Change the `/path/to` to the exact location of the Waterfox folder.

The Waterfox launcher will appear in the Gnome application drawer.

You can add the launcher into the dash-to-dock panel and right-click to open either a new window or a new private window, for every window a dot will appear by the waterfox icon.

You can use any icon you like by editing the icon path, here we use the highest resolution (256x256) Waterfox icon but in the same folder you will find 7 more icons of lower resolution
