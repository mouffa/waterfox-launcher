# waterfox-icon
Waterfox `.desktop` file which adds a firefox-like behaving launcher icon into Gnome.

This `.desktop` file has been created by customising the `firefox.desktop` file for Waterfox.

Your `firefox.desktop` file should be located in `/usr/share/applications/`.

After unpacking and running Waterfox for the first time you will find a Waterfox .desktop file in `~/.local/share/applications/`. Edit or replace the file with this one.

Change the path to the exact location of the Waterfox folder.

The Waterfox launcher will appear in the Gnome application drawer.

You can add the launcher into the dash-to-dock panel and right-click to open either a new window or a new private window, for every window a dot will appear by the waterfox icon.
